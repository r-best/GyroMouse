# GyroMouse

A project designed for use with the raspberry pi Sense HAT. The pi runs device.py and some client computer runs client.py, and the script uses the Sense HAT's gyroscope to control the movement of the mouse on the client computer. It's incredibly inconvenient to use but it was a lot of fun to make.
